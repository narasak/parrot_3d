### Introduction
The Parrot 3D is an open source 3D (fdm) printer with more rigid and reliable solution. It allows faster prints, increases precision, makes maintenance easier and reduce plastic parts for extreme precision frame.

### Why another build?
Here are the features that explain why I decided to create another printer.

* 3030 Aluminium Extrusions it is strong and rigid frame with easy to build
* Single linear rail on both X-Axis and Y-Axis it provided easier setup, alignment, silent and supper smooth
* Use more precision CNC aluminum and less printed parts (3D printed parts can crack and are less reliable)
* Support 8 types of Extruders with full build volumes (250 mm x 210 mm)
    * Bondtech LGX FF Extruder
    * Bondtech LGX for MK3S & Mosquito
    * Bondtech Prusa MK3S (E3D) Extruder
    * Bondtech Prusa MK3S (Mosquito) Extruder
    * E3D Hemera Extruder
    * Original Prusa Extruder
    * Bear Extruder (Designed by [Grégoire Saunier](https://github.com/gregsaun/bear_extruder_and_x_axis))
    * SFP Extruder (Designed
      by [Gerd Jentz](https://github.com/gerdj/RedBear/tree/master/SFP_Extruder?fbclid=IwAR3Uj-65sifwO2yWpbCwoKYdIusArH3cBH_lzmMJN2WZawB7Bh3vTl2CO8A))
